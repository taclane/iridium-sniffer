# iridium-sniffer Architecture

Standalone Iridium satellite burst detector and demodulator. Replaces gr-iridium by eliminating the GNU Radio dependency while reusing ice9-bluetooth-sniffer's SDR abstraction and build system. Outputs iridium-toolkit compatible RAW format to stdout.

```

This format is consumed directly by [iridium-toolkit](https://github.com/muccc/iridium-toolkit) for higher-layer decoding.

## Threading Design Decisions

**Why a single burst detector thread?** The FFT burst detector maintains sequential state: noise floor history, active burst list, ring buffer. Parallelizing it would require complex synchronization with no benefit since FFT computation dominates and is already vectorized.

**Why separate downmix workers?** Each burst is independent. The downmix is the most CPU-intensive stage (multiple FFTs per burst). 2 worker threads provide good throughput without excessive contention.

**Why single demod+output thread?** QPSK demod is cheap (no FFTs). Output must be serialized for stdout. Combining them in one thread avoids an extra queue and keeps the design simple.

**FFTW thread safety:** FFTW plan creation is not thread-safe even with `FFTW_ESTIMATE`. All `fftwf_plan_*` and `fftwf_destroy_plan` calls are wrapped with a global mutex (`fftw_lock.h`). Plans use `FFTW_MEASURE` for optimal runtime performance. This is different from GNU Radio where plans are created on the main thread before the flowgraph starts.

## Build

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

Dependencies: cmake >= 3.9, FFTW3 (float), pthreads, at least one SDR library for live capture (hackrf, bladerf, uhd, soapysdr). Optional: OpenCL or Vulkan for GPU-accelerated burst detection (see GPU Backends below).

## GPU Backends

Two mutually exclusive GPU backends are available for burst detection FFT acceleration. Both use VkFFT for the FFT computation and expose the same interface (`gpu_burst_fft_create/process/destroy`).

### OpenCL (default on x86 with OpenCL drivers)

```bash
cmake .. -DUSE_OPENCL=ON    # auto-detected when OpenCL is available
```

**Dependencies:** `libOpenCL` (usually from GPU driver or `ocl-icd-opencl-dev`)

Uses custom OpenCL compute kernels for window multiply and fftshift+magnitude on the GPU. The FFT runs via VkFFT's OpenCL backend (VKFFT_BACKEND=3).

### Vulkan (required for Pi5, optional on NVIDIA/AMD)

```bash
cmake .. -DUSE_VULKAN=ON -DUSE_OPENCL=OFF
```

**Dependencies:**
```bash
sudo apt install libvulkan-dev glslang-dev spirv-tools
```

Uses VkFFT's native Vulkan backend (VKFFT_BACKEND=0) for the FFT. Window multiply and fftshift+magnitude run on the CPU. This avoids custom Vulkan compute shaders, keeping the code simple (~300 lines vs ~360 for OpenCL).

Host-visible coherent memory is used for zero-copy CPU<->GPU transfers, which is efficient on shared-memory architectures (Pi5 VideoCore VII) and functional on discrete GPUs.

**Pi5 notes:** The Raspberry Pi 5's VideoCore VII GPU supports Vulkan 1.2 via Mesa's v3d driver but has no OpenCL support. The Vulkan backend was designed specifically for this platform.

### Choosing a backend

| Platform | Recommended | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| NVIDIA x86 | OpenCL | Full GPU pipeline, mature driver |
| AMD x86 | OpenCL | ROCm or Mesa OpenCL |
| Raspberry Pi 5 | Vulkan | Only GPU API available |
| No GPU / embedded | Neither | CPU FFTW fallback is fast enough at 10 MHz |

Both backends can be disabled at runtime with `--no-gpu` to force CPU FFTW processing.

### Build verification

| Configuration | Command | Result |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| OpenCL GPU | `cmake .. -DUSE_OPENCL=ON` | 3668 bursts, 70% ok |
| Vulkan GPU | `cmake .. -DUSE_VULKAN=ON -DUSE_OPENCL=OFF` | 3668 bursts, 70% ok |
| CPU only | `cmake .. -DUSE_OPENCL=OFF` or `--no-gpu` | 3668 bursts, 71% ok |

All three produce equivalent RAW output (2500-2577 lines). Minor variations are due to batch processing order differences affecting which bursts reach the demod queue first.

## Usage

```bash
# From IQ file (int8 format)
./iridium-sniffer -f recording.raw

# Live capture with SoapySDR
./iridium-sniffer -l -i soapy-0

# Pipe to iridium-toolkit
./iridium-sniffer -f recording.raw | python3 iridium-parser.py
```

### Comparison Results

| Field | gr-iridium | iridium-sniffer | Match? |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Payload symbols | 179 | 179 | Exact |
| Demodulated bits | 001100000... | 001100000... | **Byte-for-byte identical** |
| Direction | DL (implied) | DL (implied) | Exact |
| Center frequency | 1622000000 | 1621999997 | 3 Hz off |
| Magnitude | 32.12 | 32.16 | ~0.04 dB |
| Noise floor | -80.05 | -80.34 | ~0.3 dB |
| Confidence | 100% | 76% | Different (see below) |
| Level | 0.13551 | 0.43957 | Different (see below) |

### Analysis of Differences

**Demodulated bits:** Identical. This is the critical validation -- the DSP pipeline (burst detection, downmix, CFO correction, matched filtering, sync word correlation, DQPSK demod) produces the exact same decoded output as gr-iridium.

**Confidence (76% vs 100%):** Confidence measures the percentage of symbols within +/-22 degrees of their ideal QPSK constellation point. The difference is likely due to int8 quantization noise in the PLL path (gr-iridium operates on float32 throughout). This does not affect demodulation correctness -- even at 76%, all symbols are decoded identically. In live operation with real noise, both implementations will produce similar confidence values since atmospheric/thermal noise dominates quantization noise.

**Level (0.44 vs 0.14):** Different amplitude normalization. gr-iridium normalizes relative to its FFT-derived noise estimate. This implementation uses a different normalization path. This is cosmetic -- iridium-toolkit does not use the level field for decoding.

**Frequency (3 Hz off):** Within the PLL's residual CFO measurement precision. Negligible at 25,000 symbols/sec.

**Timestamp/file_info:** Different because these are derived from wall clock at program start, not from the IQ data itself.

### GPU vs CPU Verification

GPU acceleration tested by running the same synthetic test file through all paths:

- **OpenCL GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU via VkFFT (VKFFT_BACKEND=3)
  - Custom OpenCL kernels for windowing and fftshift+magnitude on GPU
- **Vulkan GPU:** Same GPU via VkFFT (VKFFT_BACKEND=0)
  - CPU window multiply and fftshift+magnitude, GPU FFT only
  - Uses host-visible coherent memory for zero-copy transfers
- **CPU path:** FFTW3 (single-frame processing)

**Result:** Demodulated bits are byte-for-byte identical across all three paths. All metadata fields (frequency, magnitude, noise, confidence, level, symbol count) match exactly. Both GPU paths are drop-in replacements with `--no-gpu` to disable.

**Build verified in four configurations:**
1. `USE_OPENCL=ON` (default when OpenCL available) -- OpenCL GPU with CPU fallback
2. `USE_VULKAN=ON` -- Vulkan GPU with CPU fallback
3. `--no-gpu` runtime flag -- forces CPU FFTW path regardless of build
4. `USE_OPENCL=OFF -DUSE_VULKAN=OFF` cmake flags -- compiles without GPU dependency

## Performance Notes

GPU vs CPU benchmarks on synthetic data (NVIDIA RTX 3060 Mobile):

| Sample Rate | FFT Size | File Duration | GPU | CPU | Notes |
|-------------|----------|---------------|-----|-----|-------|
| 2 MHz | 2048 | ~6 sec | 1.0s | 1.0s | FFT too small for GPU advantage |
| 10 MHz | 8192 | ~6 sec | 2.0s | 1.0s | GPU overhead dominates on short file |

At low sample rates the FFT is small enough that FFTW handles it trivially. The GPU advantage is expected on weaker CPUs (Pi 5) or at higher sample rates where CPU is already loaded with downmix and demod threads.

## Live SDR Testing (Phase 7)

### Setup

- **SDR:** Ettus USRP B210 (USB 3.0)
- **Antenna:** L-band antenna on RX/A with external bias tee
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU (OpenCL + VkFFT)
- **Center frequency:** 1622 MHz (Iridium L-band simplex downlink)

### Live Comparison: iridium-sniffer vs gr-iridium

All captures at 10 MHz sample rate, USRP B210, gain 40 dB, 30-second duration:

| Metric | This Tool (GPU) | This Tool (CPU) | gr-iridium |
|--------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Bursts detected (i_avg) | 254/s | 400/s | 64/s |
| UW pass rate (ok%) | 33% | 24% | 79% |
| Decoded frames (ok/s) | 83/s | 95/s | 51/s |
| Total RAW lines | 2504 | 3043 | 1367 |
| Demod queue depth | 0 | 0-1814 | 0 |

60-second sustained captures at 10 MHz:

| Metric | GPU | CPU |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Total RAW lines | 2055 | 3604 |
| ok/s avg | 33/s | 59/s |
| Queue depth | 0 | 0 |
| CRC:OK frames | 192 | 404 |

### Understanding ok% (UW Pass Rate)

The `ok%` in the stats line is the percentage of detected bursts that pass the **unique word check** (Hamming distance <= 2 from a known Iridium sync pattern). A lower ok% does **not** mean lower quality output -- it means the burst detector is more aggressive, attempting to demodulate weaker signals that a conservative detector would skip entirely.

**Why the ok% is lower than gr-iridium but it decodes more frames:**

- gr-iridium detects ~64 bursts/s and passes 79% (= ~51 ok/s)
- iridium-sniffer detects ~250-400 bursts/s and passes 24-36% (= ~83-95 ok/s)

This tool casts a wider net. The bursts that fail UW check are silently discarded -- they never appear in the output. The bursts that pass are valid decoded frames, and yielding **~2x more of them**. The extra frames come from weaker signals at the edge of detectability that gr-iridium never even attempts.

**What matters for downstream tools (iridium-toolkit) is total ok/s, not ok%.** More ok/s = more decoded ACARS, SBD, pager, and voice frames.

### Analysis

- **This tool produces ~2x more decoded frames than gr-iridium** at the same sample rate and settings.
- gr-iridium has higher ok% (79%) because it's more conservative in burst detection (only 64 bursts/s vs this tool's 254-400/s). It misses weaker bursts that this detector catches.
- On this laptop (fast CPU), the CPU FFTW path actually outperforms GPU for burst detection at 10 MHz because the 8192-point FFT is small enough that GPU batching overhead exceeds the compute savings.
- GPU advantage expected on weaker CPUs (Pi 5, embedded ARM) or at higher sample rates where CPU runs out of cycles.
- Under burst traffic (satellite pass), CPU path's demod queue can grow temporarily (d: 1814), while GPU stays at d:0. Both drain the queue during quiet periods.
- iridium-toolkit successfully parses all output: IDA, ISY, IBC, IIP, ITL, IRA, I36, VOC, VOZ, VDA, MSG frame types decoded correctly with CRC:OK.
- Real satellite data decoded: sat IDs, cell info, handoff messages, SBD payloads, timestamps.

### End-to-End Pipeline Verification

```

**Frame type breakdown (3510 RAW frames in 60s):**

| Type | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| IDA | 852 | Data access (maintenance, sync, handoff) |
| ISY | 849 | Sync frames |
| IBC | 436 | Broadcast (satellite ID, cell info, time) |
| I36 | 265 | 36-byte data frames |
| IIP | 122 | IP data |
| ITL | 117 | Telecom frames |

- 4 valid SBD packets assembled from 43 fragments

**Pager/ring alerts with GPS positions:**
- Multiple ring alerts with lat/lon coordinates (e.g., 41.63/-91.97, 32.82/-78.40)
- Satellite 099, multiple beams tracked

**SBD messages decoded**, including plaintext Iridium-to-Iridium messages.

### Bandwidth Testing

| Sample Rate | FFT Size | Bursts/s | ok% | Notes |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----|-------|
| 2 MHz | 2048 | ~1100/s | 5% | Narrow band, many false detections |
| 10 MHz | 8192 | ~250-400/s | 24-36% | Sweet spot for Iridium 1616-1626.5 MHz |
| 20 MHz | 16384 | ~73/s | 23% | Excess bandwidth, no additional Iridium signals |

10 MHz centered at 1622 MHz is optimal -- covers the full Iridium simplex downlink band without wasting processing on empty spectrum.

## Phase 8: Demod Quality Optimization

### Problem

Processing a 60-second IQ recording (`/tmp/iridium_iq_60s.cf32`, 10 MHz, cf32):
- **Before:** 3668 bursts detected, 26% ok, 923 RAW lines
- **gr-iridium:** ~3468 bursts detected, 74% ok, 2720 RAW lines

Both tools detect similar burst counts, but the initial UW (unique word) pass rate was 3x lower, meaning were discarded away 74% of detected bursts during demodulation.

### Root Causes (3 issues found via side-by-side comparison with gr-iridium)

**1. Anti-alias LPF 5x too wide (primary, ~7 dB SNR loss)**

The original filter had 100 kHz cutoff (`output_sample_rate * 0.4`). Iridium signal occupies ~35 kHz (25 kHz symbol rate * 1.4 roll-off). gr-iridium uses 20 kHz cutoff. The excess bandwidth added ~7 dB of noise to all pre-RRC processing stages (fine CFO estimation, burst start detection, sync word correlation).

Fix: Added a 25-tap noise-limiting LPF at output rate (250 kHz) with 20 kHz cutoff and 40 kHz transition, applied immediately after decimation. Cheap (25 taps at 250 kHz) and applied before all noise-sensitive stages.

**2. Single-direction UW check (secondary)**

The QPSK initially demod only checked the unique word pattern for the direction chosen by burst_downmix (DL or UL). gr-iridium checks both patterns and accepts either. When burst_downmix picks the wrong direction from a noisy correlation, the PLL can still recover the correct symbols -- but they were rejected them.

Fix: Check both DL and UL unique words; accept either match. Update direction if demod disagrees with burst_downmix.

**3. CFO FFT size rounding (minor)**

The initial implementation used `next_pow2(sps * 26) = 512` (ceil). gr-iridium uses `floor_pow2(sps * 26) = 256`. The preamble + 10 UW symbols = 260 samples at 10 sps. Using 512 extends the squared-signal FFT window 252 samples into QPSK payload data, adding noise to the CFO estimate.

Fix: Use floor-to-power-of-2 instead of ceiling.

### Results

| Metric | Before | After | gr-iridium | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|------------|-------|
| Bursts detected | 3668 | 3668 | ~3468 | Same |
| ok% (UW pass rate) | 26% | 71% | 74% | +45 pp |
| RAW lines output | 923 | 2574 | 2720 | 2.8x more |
| % of gr-iridium output | 34% | 94.6% | 100% | +60.6 pp |

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `burst_downmix.c` | Added `noise_fir` (25-tap LPF, 20 kHz cutoff at 250 kHz); applied after decimation step; CFO FFT size floor instead of ceil |
| `qpsk_demod.c` | Check both DL and UL unique words |

### Verified Non-Issues

These were investigated and confirmed identical or equivalent between this code and gr-iridium:
- PLL algorithm (mathematically identical, alpha=0.2)
- QPSK symbol mapping (Q1->0, Q2->1, Q3->2, Q4->3)
- DQPSK differential decode ({0,2,3,1} map)
- UW patterns and Hamming threshold (<=2 errors)
- RC filter formula and normalization
- RC filter padding in sync word generation
- RRC filter parameters (alpha=0.4, 51 taps, gain=1.0)
- Phase rotation from correlation peak

## Phase 9: Beyond gr-iridium

### Approach

Three techniques were tested to exceed gr-iridium's 74% ok rate:

1. **Optimal decimation offset** -- Search all 10 sample offsets for eye-diagram peak before decimation. **Result: DESTRUCTIVE** (1554 vs 2574 RAW). burst_downmix already aligns timing via sync word correlation; adding an offset misaligns symbols. Discarded.

2. **Second-order Costas loop PLL** -- Replace first-order PLL (phase-only) with second-order loop tracking both phase and frequency (integral gain beta = alpha^2/4 = 0.01). **Result: -2 lines**. The frequency integrator adds jitter on short Iridium bursts (~180 symbols), outweighing any benefit from frequency tracking. The fine CFO correction in burst_downmix already removes most frequency offset. Discarded.

3. **Soft-decision UW rescue** -- When hard-decision Hamming check fails, compute angular distance from expected constellation points in continuous domain (0 = perfect, 1.0 = one quadrant off). Accept if total soft error <= 3.0. Only runs as fallback when hard check fails, so zero cost for normal frames. **Result: +3 lines** (2577 vs 2574). Kept.

### Results

| Metric | Phase 8 | Phase 9 | gr-iridium |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| RAW lines | 2574 | 2577 | 2720 |
| % of gr-iridium | 94.6% | 94.7% | 100% |

### Analysis: Where the remaining 5% gap lives

The demod pipeline (qpsk_demod.c) is now at parity with gr-iridium -- both use identical PLL, symbol mapping, DQPSK decode, and UW patterns. The remaining gap is in the burst_downmix stage:

- **Burst start detection precision** -- sub-sample timing differences in finding preamble start
- **Filter implementation details** -- VOLK-optimized FIR vs this tool's scalar FIR may produce slightly different intermediate values due to floating-point ordering
- **Correlation peak interpolation** -- both use quadratic, but numerical differences in FFT libraries (FFTW vs GR's FFT wrapper) may shift peaks by fractions of a sample

These are diminishing returns. The 5% gap represents ~143 frames over 60 seconds of recording -- marginal signals where tiny numerical differences determine whether the sync word barely passes or barely fails.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Don't fight the alignment** -- burst_downmix's sync word correlation already provides optimal symbol timing. Adding an offset search on top is destructive.
2. **Short bursts penalize loop complexity** -- Iridium bursts (~180 symbols) don't have enough convergence time for a second-order PLL to outperform first-order. The integral term adds more noise than it removes frequency error.
3. **Soft-decision rescue is architecturally sound** -- it only activates when hard check fails (zero cost path for normal frames) and correctly rescues frames where symbols fall near quadrant boundaries.

## Phase 11: Built-in Web Map

### Frame Decoder

The frame decoder (`frame_decode.c`) parses demodulated bits into structured IRA and IBC frames. It runs inline in the demod thread when `--web` is enabled, adding negligible overhead.

**Parsing pipeline:**

1. **Access code check** -- After DQPSK decode, the UW symbols become the access code bits. The first 24 bits of the demodulated output are compared against the known DL and UL patterns. Frames that don't match are skipped.

2. **IBC detection** -- The first 6 bits after the access code are checked as a BCH(7,3) header. If valid, the following 64-bit block is de-interleaved and BCH-checked. If both pass, the frame is an IBC.

3. **IRA detection** -- The first 96 bits after the access code are de-interleaved via a three-way split and all three 31-bit blocks are BCH-checked. If all pass, the frame is an IRA.

4. **BCH error correction** -- Pre-computed syndrome tables (built at startup) enable correction of up to 2 bit errors per block for BCH(31,21) and 1 bit for BCH(7,3). Uncorrectable blocks cause the frame to be skipped.

5. **De-interleaving** -- Iridium uses pair-swapping followed by reverse-stride distribution. `de_interleave()` splits 64 input bits into two 32-bit streams; `de_interleave3()` splits 96 bits into three. This follows the same algorithm as iridium-toolkit's bitsparser.py.

6. **Field extraction** -- IRA frames contain satellite ID, beam ID, geocentric XYZ position (converted to lat/lon/alt via atan2), and up to 12 paging blocks with TMSI and MSC ID. IBC frames contain satellite ID, beam ID, timeslot, and optionally the LBFC (Iridium time counter).

**BCH parameters:**

| Polynomial | Block Length | Data Bits | Syndrome Bits | Correction | Used For |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------------|------------|----------|
| 1207 | 31 | 21 | 10 | 2-bit | IRA/IBC data blocks |
| 3545 | 31 | 20 | 11 | 2-bit | IDA payload blocks |
| 29 | 7 | 3 | 4 | 1-bit | IBC header, LCW component 1 |
| 465 | 14 | 5 | 8 | 1-bit | LCW component 2 |
| 41 | 26 | 21 | 5 | 2-bit | LCW component 3 |

### Web Map Server

The web map (`web_map.c`) is a minimal POSIX socket HTTP server that runs in a background thread. It serves three endpoints:

- `GET /` -- Returns an embedded HTML page with Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap tiles. The entire page is a C string literal compiled into the binary. Nothing is loaded from disk.
- `GET /api/events` -- Server-Sent Events stream. Pushes a full JSON state snapshot once per second. Each SSE client runs in its own detached pthread.
- `GET /api/state` -- Returns a single JSON snapshot of the current state.

**State management:**

- Ring alert points are stored in a circular buffer (2000 entries). Each entry includes lat/lon, altitude, satellite/beam IDs, TMSI, and frequency.
- Satellite entries are tracked in a flat array (100 max), updated on each IBC frame.
- All state is protected by a single mutex. JSON serialization limits output to the 500 most recent ring alerts for browser performance.
- `SIGPIPE` is set to `SIG_IGN` in `main()` so broken SSE connections don't terminate the process.

**Verification (60-second IQ recording at 10 MHz):**

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| IRA frames decoded | 151 |
| IBC frames decoded | 269 |
| Unique satellites seen | 59 |
| RAW output (stdout) | 2577 lines (identical with and without --web) |

## Phase 12: GSMTAP Output (Wireshark Integration)

### IDA Frame Decoder

The IDA decoder (`ida_decode.c`) processes IDA (Iridium Data Access) frames -- the signaling channel that carries call setup, SMS, SBD, and location updates. Unlike IRA/IBC frames which use BCH(31,21), IDA frames use a different structure:

**LCW (Link Control Word) extraction:**
1. First 46 bits after access code are permuted via a fixed table
2. Pair-swap applied before permutation (LCW table expects symbol_reverse'd input)
3. Three BCH components decoded: lcw1 (7-bit, FT field), lcw2 (14-bit), lcw3 (26-bit)
4. FT==2 identifies IDA frames

**Payload descrambling (bits 46+ after access code):**
1. Split into 124-bit blocks
2. Each block: de-interleave 62 symbols into 2x62 bits
3. Concatenate halves, split into 4x31-bit chunks
4. Reorder as [chunk4, chunk2, chunk3, chunk1]
5. BCH(31,20) decode each chunk (poly=3545, 2048-entry syndrome table)
6. Extract 20 data bits per chunk

**IDA fields (from BCH-decoded bitstream):**
- Continuation flag (bit 3)
- Sequence counter da_ctr (bits 5-7, 0-7)
- Payload length da_len (bits 11-15, 0-20 bytes)
- Payload data (bits 20-179, 20 bytes)
- CRC-CCITT (bits 180-195)

**Multi-burst reassembly:**
- 16 concurrent reassembly slots (static, no allocation)
- Match rules: same direction, frequency within 260 Hz, time within 280 ms, sequence = (prev+1)%8
- ctr==0 + cont==0 -> single-burst message (immediate callback)
- ctr==0 + cont==1 -> start multi-burst, accumulate payload
- cont==0 -> message complete, fire callback
- Timeout: slots older than 1000 ms silently discarded

### GSMTAP Output

GSMTAP (`gsmtap.c`) wraps reassembled IDA payloads in a 16-byte GSMTAP header and sends them as UDP datagrams to Wireshark.

**GSMTAP header fields:**
- version=2, hdr_len=4 (16 bytes), type=2 (ABIS)
- ARFCN: Iridium channel number = (freq - 1616 MHz) / 41.667 kHz, with uplink flag 0x4000
- signal_dbm: 20*log10(burst magnitude)
- frame_number: raw frequency in Hz

**Verification (60-second IQ recording at 10 MHz):**

| Metric | iridium-sniffer | iridium-toolkit |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| IDA frames detected | 493 | 468 |
| CRC-OK frames | 252 | 240 |
| GSMTAP packets sent | 225 | N/A |
| RAW output (stdout) | 2577 lines (identical with and without --gsmtap) |

Wireshark correctly decodes the packets as GSM/LAPDm signaling, showing Immediate Assignment, Location Update Reject, Paging Request, and other message types.

## Known Issues

- Confidence runs lower than gr-iridium on synthetic data due to int8 quantization effects in constellation measurement. Does not affect bit-level correctness.
- GPU burst detection is slower than CPU on fast x86 CPUs at 10 MHz (GPU batching overhead). Expected to help on weaker CPUs (Pi 5) or higher sample rates.
- Vulkan backend not yet tested on Raspberry Pi 5 hardware (verified on NVIDIA only).
- ~5% remaining gap vs gr-iridium (2577 vs 2720 RAW lines on 60s test file). Root cause is in burst_downmix numerical precision, not demod algorithms. Diminishing returns to close further.
- Phase 8-9 demod improvements verified on offline IQ file only. Live SDR testing pending.
